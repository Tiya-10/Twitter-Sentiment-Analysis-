Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze large-scale tweet data.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the sentiment analysis model can be found on Kaggle:
Twitter Sentiment Dataset - 1.6M

Features
Sentiment Classification: Classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Cleans and preprocesses tweets, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.

Machine Learning Models: Implements various ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Deep Learning models.

Real-time Analysis: Can analyze live tweets for sentiment.

Visualization: Displays sentiment distribution and key insights using plots.

Installation

python sentiment_analysis.py
Results
The model achieves X% accuracy on the test dataset (replace with your actual result). It successfully classifies tweets with high precision and recall.

Future Enhancements
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.

Improve sentiment detection using transformer models like BERT.

Perform aspect-based sentiment analysis.
